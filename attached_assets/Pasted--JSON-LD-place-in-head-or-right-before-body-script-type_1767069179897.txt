            "@type": "Answer",

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Waking near the end of a cycle may reduce sleep inertia (that groggy feeling), because you’re less likely to wake from deep sleep. It’s not perfect—sleep stages aren’t a stopwatch—but cycle-based planning is a useful starting point."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A wake window is a small time range (like 10–15 minutes) around your target bedtime or wake time. It adds flexibility so you can aim for a window instead of a single exact minute, while keeping the overall cycle timing similar."
