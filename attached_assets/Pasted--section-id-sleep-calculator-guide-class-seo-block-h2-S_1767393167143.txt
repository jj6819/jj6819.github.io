  <h2>Sleep Calculator: find the best time to go to bed or wake up</h2>
  <p>
    NightOwl Sleep Calc is a free sleep calculator that helps you plan bedtimes and wake-up times using sleep cycles,
    sleep latency (how long it takes you to fall asleep), and a wake window (a small flexible range instead of one exact minute).
    If you’ve ever woken up groggy even after “enough” hours of sleep, timing your wake-up closer to the end of a cycle can help.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn’t a medical tool—just practical sleep math. Pick a wake-up time to get recommended bedtimes, or choose “Bedtime now”
    to see the best wake-up windows based on your settings. Adjust the sliders to match your real-life routine, and use the wake window
    to give yourself a little breathing room.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use this sleep calculator</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Choose a mode:</strong> “Wake up at…” for bedtime suggestions, or “Bedtime now” for wake-up suggestions.</li>
    <li><strong>Set your sleep latency:</strong> how long you usually take to fall asleep (many people are around 10–20 minutes).</li>
    <li><strong>Set cycle length:</strong> 90 minutes is typical, but you can adjust if you tend to run shorter or longer.</li>
    <li><strong>Pick a wake window:</strong> a small range (like 10–15 minutes) so you can aim for a window, not a single exact time.</li>
    <li><strong>Pick an option:</strong> choose the cycle count that fits your schedule, then copy or share the plan.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
  <p>
    These common scenarios show how a sleep calculator can help you plan around real life. Your results may differ based on settings,
    but the idea is the same: plan sleep in full cycles and account for the time it takes to fall asleep.

  <div class="example-grid">
    <div class="example-card">
      <h3>If you need to wake up early</h3>
      <p>
        Select your wake-up time in “Wake up at…” mode. The calculator will suggest multiple bedtimes (4–7 cycles).
        Most people feel best with about <strong>5–6 cycles</strong>, but if you’re short on time, 4 cycles can be a workable minimum.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-card">
      <h3>If you’re going to bed now</h3>
      <p>
        Tap “Bedtime now” to use the current time, then choose a wake-up option.
        Picking a wake time near the end of a cycle can reduce <strong>sleep inertia</strong>—that heavy, foggy feeling after waking.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-card">
      <h3>If you only have limited time</h3>
      <p>
        Choose a lower cycle count that fits your schedule. Even if you can’t get a full night, waking closer to a cycle boundary
        may feel better than waking from deep sleep. Use the wake window so you can pick what’s realistic.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-card">
      <h3>If you’re always “in bed” longer than planned</h3>
      <p>
        Increase sleep latency to match how long it usually takes you to fall asleep. This makes bedtime and wake-up recommendations
        more realistic, especially if you tend to lie awake or wind down for a while.

  <h2 id="sleep-cycles">Sleep cycles, sleep latency, and wake windows explained</h2>
  <h3>What is a sleep cycle?</h3>
  <p>
    Sleep isn’t one steady state—your brain moves through repeating stages, including lighter sleep, deeper sleep, and REM.
    A full sleep cycle often averages around <strong>90 minutes</strong>, though it varies by person and by night. This calculator uses cycle timing
    to suggest bedtimes or wake-up times that may reduce grogginess.
  </p>

  <h3>What is sleep latency?</h3>
  <p>
    Sleep latency is the time it takes to fall asleep after you get into bed. Many people are around 10–20 minutes, but stress, caffeine,
    late screens, or irregular schedules can increase it. Setting an accurate latency helps the calculator match your real routine.
  </p>

  <h3>What is a wake window?</h3>
  <p>
    A wake window is a small flexible range around a recommended time (for example, 10–15 minutes). It makes planning easier because you can aim
    for a window rather than a single exact minute, while staying close to an end-of-cycle wake-up.

  <h2>Sleep Calculator FAQ</h2>

  <h3>How many sleep cycles do I need?</h3>
  <p>
    Many adults feel best with about 5–6 full cycles, which is roughly 7.5–9 hours of sleep time (plus sleep latency).
    If you’re catching up on sleep, 6–7 cycles may help; if you’re short on time, 4 cycles can be a workable minimum.
  </p>

  <h3>Why does the calculator use 90-minute cycles?</h3>
  <p>
    A full sleep cycle often averages around 90 minutes, but it can be shorter or longer depending on the person and the night.
    If your results consistently feel early or late, try adjusting cycle length by a few minutes and see what matches your mornings.
  </p>

  <h3>What’s a normal sleep latency?</h3>
  <p>
    Sleep latency is how long it takes to fall asleep once you’re in bed. A common range is 10–20 minutes, but it varies with stress,
    caffeine, exercise, and screens. If you often take 30+ minutes, increase the latency setting so recommendations stay realistic.
  </p>

  <h3>Is it better to wake at the end of a sleep cycle?</h3>
  <p>
    Waking near the end of a cycle may reduce sleep inertia because you’re less likely to wake from deep sleep.
    Sleep stages aren’t perfectly predictable, but cycle-based timing is a practical way to improve your odds.
  </p>

  <h3>What is sleep inertia?</h3>
  <p>
    Sleep inertia is the groggy, heavy feeling some people get after waking—especially when waking from deep sleep.
    Timing your alarm closer to a lighter stage (often near a cycle boundary) can make waking feel smoother.
  </p>

  <h3>What is a wake window?</h3>
  <p>
    A wake window is a small range around a recommended bedtime or wake-up time, like 10–15 minutes.
    It adds flexibility so you can pick a time that fits your routine while staying close to the cycle-based plan.
  </p>

  <h3>Can this sleep calculator replace medical advice?</h3>
  <p>
    No. This tool is educational and can help you plan timing, but it can’t diagnose sleep problems or replace professional guidance.
    If you have persistent insomnia, loud snoring, or severe daytime sleepiness, consider talking with a clinician.
