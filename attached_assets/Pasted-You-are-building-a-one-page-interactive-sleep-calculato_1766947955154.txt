You are building a one-page interactive sleep calculator website (original, not a copy of sleepcalculator.com) using ONLY plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks). It must run in Replit as a static site.

GOAL
Create a mobile-first, polished one-page site called “NightOwl Sleep Planner” with:
- Two modes: “Wake up at…” and “Go to bed now”
- Adjustable settings (latency, cycle length)
- Results shown as selectable time cards
- A cute ORIGINAL Owl mascot (inline SVG) with subtle animations + reactions

REPLIT SETUP
- Create: index.html, styles.css, script.js
- Link CSS + JS in index.html
- No external build tools. Optional: use a lightweight time-picker polyfill ONLY if absolutely necessary, but prefer native <input type="time">.
- Everything must work by clicking “Run” in Replit.

CORE FEATURES
1) Mode Toggle
- Toggle buttons: “Wake up at” and “Bedtime now”
- In “Wake up at”: user selects a wake time (time input).
- In “Bedtime now”: use current local time as bedtime start (update on button press “Use current time”).

2) Calculation Rules (editable via settings)
- Sleep latency: default 15 minutes (range 0–60)
- Sleep cycle length: default 90 minutes (range 80–110)
- Recommended cycles shown: 4, 5, 6, 7 (show all; highlight 5 and 6 as “recommended”)
- For “Wake up at”:
  bedtime = wakeTime - (cycles * cycleLength) - latency
- For “Bedtime now”:
  wakeTime = now + latency + (cycles * cycleLength)
- Handle wrap-around across midnight correctly.

3) Results UI
- Display 4–7 cycle options as cards/chips:
  - Large time
  - Cycles count
  - “Time in bed” (cycles * cycleLength + latency) formatted as “Xh Ym”
- Clicking a result:
  - sets it as “selected”
  - provides “Copy” button (copy the selected time text to clipboard)
  - triggers Owl reaction + “zzz” bubble animation if a bedtime option was chosen
- Add “Share link” button:
  - Encodes mode, time, latency, cycleLength into URL query params
  - On load, read query params and restore state

4) Settings + Persistence
- Sliders for latency and cycle length with live value labels
- Persist settings + last mode/time in localStorage
- Respect 12/24h: default use user locale display (Intl.DateTimeFormat) but accept native time input value

UNIQUENESS (MUST IMPLEMENT)
Add a “Wake Window” feature to differentiate:
- Slider: Wake window size (0–30 min, default 15)
- In results, show a window for each recommendation:
  - e.g., “6:30–6:45” (wake) or “10:45–11:00” (bed), depending on mode
- Rank/highlight the best two options based on:
  - recommended cycles (5–6)
  - and closeness to user’s selected time (if applicable)

OWL MASCOT (MUST IMPLEMENT, ORIGINAL ART)
- Place Owl near the results header or in the corner of the main card.
- Owl must be an inline SVG you create (simple shapes are fine; do not copy existing owl artwork).
- Animations:
  A) Idle:
     - Slow blink every ~7–10 seconds (eyelids close then open)
     - Gentle breathing (subtle scale/translate)
  B) On selecting a bedtime/wake result:
     - Head tilt (rotate a few degrees then return)
     - Wing tuck (wing moves inward slightly)
  C) When selecting bedtime (or when mode is bedtime-related):
     - “zzz” bubble appears near beak, floats up and fades out over 1.5–2 seconds
- Include “Fun mode 🦉” toggle:
  - When OFF: Owl is static, no zzz.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion:
  - If user prefers reduced motion, disable all animations by default and force Fun mode OFF (but allow manual ON with a warning text “Animations enabled”).

ACCESSIBILITY
- Buttons and inputs must have labels
- Keyboard navigation: results selectable with Enter/Space
- ARIA-live region for “copied!” feedback

DESIGN
- Original color palette (not sleepcalculator.com).
- Clean typography, rounded cards, subtle shadows.
- Provide short original explanatory text about sleep cycles and latency (do not copy wording).
- Dark mode optional, but nice if easy (CSS prefers-color-scheme).

DELIVERABLES
- index.html: semantic structure with header, main, footer
- styles.css: responsive styling + owl animations
- script.js: all logic, utilities, event handlers
- README in a comment at top of script.js explaining how to use and how the math works.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Produce complete code for all three files.
- Ensure it runs without errors in Replit.
- Test with a few example times in comments.
- Do not include copyrighted content or copy text from other sites.
